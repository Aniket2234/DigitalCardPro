# Netlify Deployment Guide

Your application is now fully configured for Netlify deployment! ðŸš€

## What's Been Configured

1. **SPA Routing Fix**: Added `_redirects` file to prevent crashes when refreshing pages
2. **Netlify Configuration**: Created `netlify.toml` with proper build settings
3. **Build Process**: Configured to output static files to `dist/public`

## How to Deploy to Netlify

### Option 1: Deploy via Netlify UI (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to Git** (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
   
2. **Go to Netlify** (https://app.netlify.com)
   
3. **Click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"**
   
4. **Connect your Git repository**
   
5. **Netlify will auto-detect the settings from `netlify.toml`**:
   - Build command: `vite build`
   - Publish directory: `dist/public`
   
6. **Click "Deploy site"**

### Option 2: Deploy via Netlify CLI

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

## Important Notes

- The `_redirects` file ensures that client-side routing works correctly
- All routes will redirect to `index.html` for proper SPA behavior
- No crashes will occur when refreshing any page
- The build output is optimized for production

## Testing Locally

To test the production build locally:

```bash
# Build the project
vite build

# Serve the build folder (install serve if needed)
npx serve dist/public
```

Your app is ready for Netlify! ðŸŽ‰
